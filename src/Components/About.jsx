              I am a software developer with robotics software and full stack web development experience. My specialty is picking up any stacks fast, coming from low level programming experience. I'm versatile in Javascript based stacks such as MERN (Mongo, Express, React, and Node) Stack frameworks on both SQL and NoSQL databases. Iâ€™ve been a passionate developer since 2013, as a robotics software/electrical engineer participating in international robotics competitions to creating personal projects, freelancing, full-time works at interesting companies.

              As much as I enjoy the world of technology, I love exploring the
              real world. Iâ€™ve gone on rock climbing trips all over the world including US, Mexico,
              Thailand, and Korea to find the purest and the most breath-taking
              challenging lines out there. Instead of just â€˜beingâ€™ outdoors, I like to be
              â€˜doingâ€™ the outdoors. My passion in climbing took me on a wild
              rocky journey from working at Austin Bouldering Project as a
              routesetter in the biggest bouldering gym in the North America, to all
              the way to competing in USA Climbing Collegiate National
              Championships and placing 5th place.

              One may say itâ€™s an obsession or others may say itâ€™s a passion. Do
              I mind what it is? Nope. I just want to keep doing what's fun and
              hopefully be that one person who is going to be known for being
              the best at what I do.
